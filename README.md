# SDEV_255_Final_Project_Group4

Our Group Members: 
Alexa Scott (“Project Manager”) 
Katharine Brumback 
Kristina Brown 

Our Communication Plan: 
Our group has decided to use discord to communicate with each other. This will be the easiest way to communicate, but we are not limited to this option. If needed we can also use our Ivy Learn Mailbox, Zoom, or Email. Our group has decided to meet at different times of the week since all our schedules are different. Communication has been very simple, and we are all on the same page as far as the Final Project goes.  

Our Roles and Responsibilities: 
We plan to evenly distribute the roles and responsibilities.
